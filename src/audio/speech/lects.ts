/**
 * The peoples, by the way they talk.

 * prominent each piece of it is, how fast and how wide they say it, and what
 * they say when they meet you.
 *
 * The two are not a split down the middle. They share about fifteen phonemes,
 * so a villager and a cityfolk sound like they come from the same planet, and
 * about a third of the chart is used by neither — headroom for the peoples
 * that come later.
